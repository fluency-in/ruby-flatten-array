# Ruby: Flatten Array

Write a program that will take a nested list and returns a single list with all values except nill/null

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any null/nill values. 
 
For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]


The tests use the Minitest testing framework. To install it run the command:

    gem install minitest

Run the tests with the `ruby` command:

    ruby flatten_array_test.rb
